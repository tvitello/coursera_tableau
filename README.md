Tableau dashboard from the "Fundamentals of Visualization with Tableau" course on Coursera.

Here, the MakeoverMonday, Year 2021, Week 19 dataset was used for a simple dashboard.

Said dashboard is posted to Tableau's public page, here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/travis.vitello/viz/Vitello-1GB-Internet-Makeover/Dashboard1

The original dataset (2021/W19: What Does 1GB of Mobile Data Cost by Country?) is available here: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2021w19 (also included in this repo).

Enjoy!
